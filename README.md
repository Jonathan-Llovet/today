# today

today is a music project supported and aided by algorithmic composition. This repository contains compositions, scripts, and tools involved in the project.

## Resources

today started out using Haskell and the [Euterpea](http://euterpea.com/) library for its compositions, based on the book [The Haskell School of Music](https://www.amazon.com/Haskell-School-Music-Signals-Symphonies/dp/1108416756/).
